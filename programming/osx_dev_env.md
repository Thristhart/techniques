As a front end engineer at [Verve](https://vervemobile.com) I've had to get used to working on a macbook -- not exactly the linux-over-ssh development environment I'm used to. But OSX is still Unix, and it doesn't take too much tweaking to make it very nice. Here's my ad development setup:
<h2>Terminal</h2>
First step is to pin the terminal to the dock, because I use it all the time.

Then I go into the terminal settings and add background transparency, because it looks cool as hell:

Now we want to set up a nice bash prompt. I like having a seperator to visually separate commands. I'd also like to have some useful information such as timestamp, current directory and git status on my prompt. All of this becomes a bit unwieldy to put in PS1, so I'm using PROMPT_COMMAND and a bash file at `~/.bash_prompt`. 
Here's my `~/.profile`:

    export PROMPT_COMMAND='~/.bash_prompt'
    export PS1="\033[33m\w)\e[0m ";
    
And here's `~/.bash_prompt`:

    #!/bin/bash
    source ~/.git-prompt.sh
    
    export GIT_PS1_SHOWDIRTYSTATE=TRUE
    export GIT_PS1_SHOWUNTRACKEDFILES=TRUE
    export GIT_PS1_SHOWUPSTREAM='verbose count name'
    
    data=$(__git_ps1 '%s | ')$(date +"%r")
    datalength=${#data}
    
    cols=$(tput cols);
    cols=$((cols-datalength))
    
    s=$(printf "%*s" $cols);
    export PROMPT_SEPERATOR=$(echo "${s// /â€•}");
    
    echo -e "\033[32m$PROMPT_SEPERATOR$(tput bold)$data$(tput sgr0)"

`~/.git-prompt.sh` is <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/git/git/master/contrib/completion/git-prompt.sh">git-prompt.sh</a>, a very useful helper script for putting git repo status in your prompt.

I combine it plus the date function to get the `data` variable, which looks something like: `encode-task u= origin/encode-task | 02:50:09 PM`. Then I subtract the length of that from the width of the terminal to get how many "filler" characters I need to build the seperator. Finally I use printf and some substitution magic to generate exactly enough dashes to fill the width of the terminal + the miscellaneous data.

Here's what this ends up looking like:

<h2>Tools</h2>
Next step is to get XCode, which has build tools and most importantly comes with iOS Simulator, which is very useful for testing a variety of configurations of Safari for our ad builds.

I'm using Xcode-beta, (as of this writing, version 7.3) because I like experimental features. I launch iOS Simulator via right clicking on the Xcode dock icon, Open Developer Tool, Simulator. I then pin the iOS simulator to the dock in the same way I pinned Terminal so that I don't need to launch XCode to open iOS simulator.
